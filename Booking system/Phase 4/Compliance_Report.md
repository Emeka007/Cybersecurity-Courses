## 7. 🧪 Anonymization & Pseudonymization

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Anonymization implemented | ⚠️ | Not fully covered — potential improvement. |
| Pseudonymization used | ⚠️ | Not explicitly implemented. |

## 🟢 Final Verdict: Phase 4 Status

| Overall Compliance | Status |
|--------------------|--------|
| **GDPR Phase 4** | ✅ **Mostly Compliant** |

### ✅ Fully Compliant Areas:
- Personal Data Mapping
- Booking Visibility
- Access Control
- Security Measures
- Subject Rights
- Documentation

### ⚠️ Minor Enhancements Needed:
- Server-side **age enforcement** (≥15)
- **Log review** to avoid storing PII
- Consider **pseudonymization** in logs or analytics

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- ✅ **Audit age restriction logic** — enforce on both client and server.
- ✅ **Review and clean up logs** — ensure no direct identifiers are stored.
- ✅ **Implement pseudonymization** — especially for logging or analytics.
- ✅ **Document these improvements** — for audit trails and accountability.
