# Authorization Testing Report

## Introduction

This report provides a detailed analysis of the authorization testing performed on the Booking System. The objective of this test was to evaluate the system's access control mechanisms and ensure users can only access resources permitted by their role.

## Test Objectives

- Verify that users cannot access unauthorized resources
- Ensure proper implementation of role-based access control (RBAC)
- Identify potential flaws in the authorization process

## Testing Methodology

The following methods were used for testing:

- **Role-based testing:** Validating permissions based on user roles (Admin, User, Guest)
- **Direct access testing:** Attempting to access restricted resources using direct URLs
- **Privilege escalation testing:** Simulating unauthorized role changes
- **API testing:** Evaluating endpoints for improper access control

## Test Scenarios

| Test Case ID | Role  | Action                      | Expected Outcome  | Actual Outcome    |
|--------------|-------|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| TC-01        | Admin | Access admin dashboard      | Access granted    | Access granted    |
| TC-02        | User  | Access admin dashboard      | Access denied     | Access denied     |
| TC-03        | Guest | Access user profile         | Access denied     | Access denied     |
| TC-04        | User  | Modify own profile          | Access granted    | Access granted    |
| TC-05        | User  | Modify another user's profile | Access denied    | Access denied     |

## Findings

- Authorization controls are generally effective
- Minor issues observed in privilege escalation scenarios
- Direct URL access is properly restricted

## Recommendations

- Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive actions
- Review privilege escalation controls to prevent role tampering
- Conduct periodic access control reviews

## Conclusion

The authorization testing confirms the Booking System's access control mechanisms are effective, with minor improvements suggested for optimal security.
