## 📝 Notes

- Endpoints like `/api/resources` and `/api/reservations/14` are accessible by both the reserver and admin, while guests are restricted.
- Admin-only resources include `/api/users` and `/logout`.
- Guest users have access to public pages such as `/register` and `/static/reservationsForm.js`.
- Reserver-only access for endpoints like `/reservation` and `/reservation?id=14` for managing their own reservations.

## 🧠 Key Observations

### Guest Access:
- Can access static files and session endpoint.
- Restricted from reservation/resource data.
- ⚠️ Can try accessing `/resources` via direct URL (*12).

### Reserver Access:
- Can access their own resources and reservations.
- ⚠️ May access or edit others' reservations via ID in URL (*16).
- Can change reserver name (*11) — potential impersonation or data integrity risk.

### Admin Access:
- Full access to all endpoints as expected.
