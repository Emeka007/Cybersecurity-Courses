## **2️⃣ Updated Findings**
### **🔴 Critical Findings**
#### **1️⃣ XSS Injection in Comments Section**
- **Description:** The comment box **does not sanitize user input**, allowing malicious JavaScript execution.
- **Impact:** Attackers can **steal user cookies** or perform **defacement attacks**.
- **Tested Payload:**
  ```html
  <script>alert('Hacked!')</script>
Recommendation: Implement input sanitization and use Content Security Policy (CSP).
2️⃣ Broken Access Control
Description: The admin panel is accessible without authentication.
Impact: Unauthorized users can modify booking data.
Recommendation: Use role-based authentication and restrict access.
🟡 Medium Findings
3️⃣ Weak Password Policy
Description: The system allows passwords like "12345678", making brute-force attacks easy.
Recommendation: Enforce strong password policies:
Minimum 12 characters
Uppercase & lowercase letters
Numbers & special characters
4️⃣ Predictable Session Tokens
Description: Tokens do not use secure random generation.
Impact: Attackers can guess session tokens and hijack accounts.
Recommendation: Use secure, randomly generated session IDs.
🟢 Low Findings
5️⃣ Information Disclosure
Description: Server response headers reveal framework details (e.g., Express.js).
Impact: Attackers can target known vulnerabilities.
Recommendation: Remove unnecessary headers like X-Powered-By.
3️⃣ Tools Used
Tool	Purpose
